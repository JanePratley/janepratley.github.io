## What to expect from an initial postural assessment?
<BR>
We will spend time at the beginning of the session discussing what you hope to achieve from working together. We will then discuss your abilities, health and physical disability issues and lifestyle as to be successful postural care strategies and equipment need to be simple and enable you to live your life.

We then move onto exploring your postural alignment when sitting and lying on your back. Whilst lying down we will assess the degree of comfortable movement in your hips, knees and feet as well as the alignment of your spine and pelvis. We may also look at your arms and hand movements whilst in this position. We are usually able to give some initial recommendations regarding how to improve your comfort and alignment in lying at this stage. If appropriate and possible we will try to explore your sitting posture on the edge of the bed with support.
