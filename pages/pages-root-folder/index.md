Posture Partnership believes that postural care should be the foundation upon which all care and rehabilitation should be built.

Body shape changes brought about by reduced mobility should not be inevitable and prevention is important at all stages of life.  

Posture Partnership believes that though collaborative working and training anybody can be empowered to make a profound impact on the quality and even length of people's lives through a postural care approach.
